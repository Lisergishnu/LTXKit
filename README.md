# LTXKit
Transmission Line Design Python Toolkit

## Usage

From the Python interpreter:

```python
import LTXKit
```

or:

```python
from LTXKit import *
```
  
From there you can call the functions individually.

Currently the toolkit only has functions related to microstrip lines. Contributions appreciated via pull requests.
